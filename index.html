        <p >Hi, I'm Daniel Macarthur Senthil Kumar. I'm training to be a full-stack engineer and data scientist. I worked on the physics-based phenomenon of entropy and its impact on information loss theory also infinite markets theory in economics.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">My Research Work on Navier-stokes Equation</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">I have worked both in biology and computer science. I have researched on homosapiens and neanderthals with respect to their evolution through different stages of survival with respect to their skull sizes as well as  
            cutting-edge Navier-Stokes equation 
          that tracks the drag coefficient of a race-car in a vacuum or a tunnel</p>

        <img src="Images/navier.png" alt="Rocket Image" width="500" height="250">
        <p>In infants and toddlers (6–36 months), higher touchscreen use is linked to less nighttime sleep, more daytime sleep, and longer time to fall asleep.</p>
        <p>A cross‑sectional study in 6–36‑month‑olds found that greater screen exposure (especially TV and smartphones) predicted poorer adherence to sleep‑need recommendations and more night awakenings</p>
        <p>Overall, increased screen time is associated with declining physical and psychological health, including sleep disturbances, in children and adolescents.</p>
        <p>Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin and disrupts circadian rhythms; stimulating content and bedtime use increase physiological arousal and displace sleep time</p>
        <h1>I recently read Nikola Tesla's autobiography "My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla"</h1>
        <p2>Found that the holy bible is a famous read amongst minds that chase perfection, where Mr.Tesla quotes in pg 31 that "At this time, I made a further careful study of the Bible, and
                   discovered the key in Revelation" .</p2>
        <p>My recent findings regarding IQ and mental capacity led me to different sources of knowledge and awareness of different personalities that ruled the top pinnacles of society. </p>

        <p> What are Transformers in LLMS-[Large Language Models].</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Transformers are the core neural network architecture that power modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLaMA. They are designed to understand and generate language by processing text in parallel and capturing long-range relationships between words.</p>
        <hr>
        <p> I aim to build a second GPT powered by cloud frameworks. My philosophy is to leverage scalable infrastructure and advanced AI techniques to create a more efficient and powerful language model.</p>
